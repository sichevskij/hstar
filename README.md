Parametrization of stars based on multi bands photometry
===

The development and application of new methods for intelligent analysis and
extraction of information from digital sky surveys carried out in various
spectral domains have now become a popular field in astrophysical research
and, in particular, in stellar studies.

This package provides a clinet-server implementation of parametrization of
stars based on multi bands photometry.
